# Contributing to neuroclaude

Thank you for your interest in contributing to neuroclaude! This project thrives on community collaboration and real-world testing.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

**Reality-Based Development**: We only include features that have been actually tested and verified in real Claude Code sessions.

**Negotiation-First**: All contributions should follow our structured collaboration approach.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### 1. 📝 Pattern Contributions (Most Valuable!)

Share your real collaboration experiences:

**Success Patterns** (`ai_docs/patterns/successful_approaches.md`):
```markdown
## 📝 Case #XXX: [Title]
### 📅 Date: YYYY-MM-DD
### 🎯 Goal: [Specific objective]
### 💡 Collaboration Process: [Step-by-step negotiation]
### ✅ Applied Solution: [Actual implementation]
### 🎯 Key Success Factors: [Why it worked]
### 💎 Core Lessons: [Reusable insights]
```

**Lessons Learned** (`ai_docs/patterns/lessons_learned.md`):
```markdown
## 📝 Case #XXX: [Problem/Failure]
### 📅 Date: YYYY-MM-DD
### 🔍 Problem: [What went wrong]
### 💭 Incorrect Thinking: [Why you thought that way]
### ✅ Correct Approach: [What should have been done]
### 💎 Core Lessons: [Future reference insights]
```

### 2. 🔧 Template Improvements

- Enhance the main template (`neuroclaude.template.md`)
- Improve documentation clarity
- Add domain-specific variations
- Create quick-start guides

### 3. 🌍 Internationalization

Help make neuroclaude accessible globally:
- Translate documentation to your language
- Adapt cultural context for collaboration patterns
- Share region-specific usage patterns

### 4. 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Test the negotiation protocol in your workflows
- Document edge cases and limitations
- Verify claims with actual usage data
- Report what works and what doesn't

## 📋 Contribution Process

### Before You Start
1. **Experience the system yourself** - Don't contribute based on theory alone
2. **Read existing patterns** - Understand the established format
3. **Follow the negotiation protocol** - Even in your contribution process!

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Fork & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/neuroclaude.git
cd neuroclaude
```

#### 2. Apply the System
Create your own `CLAUDE.md` and actually use the negotiation protocol in your work.

#### 3. Document Your Experience
Record real patterns, not hypothetical ones. Include:
- ✅ What actually happened
- ✅ Specific dialogue examples  
- ✅ Measurable outcomes
- ❌ Theoretical benefits
- ❌ Assumed advantages

#### 4. Submit Your Contribution
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-pattern-name
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [Brief description of your contribution]"
git push origin feature/your-pattern-name
```

#### 5. Create Pull Request

## 🚫 What We DON'T Accept

### Theoretical Contributions
- ❌ "This should work because..."
- ❌ Untested improvements
- ❌ Speculative benefits
- ❌ AI-generated content without human validation

### Overly Complex Solutions
- ❌ "Perfect automation" claims
- ❌ Unrealistic reproducibility promises  
- ❌ Technology that doesn't actually work with Claude Code

### Non-Collaborative Approaches
- ❌ Solutions that bypass human judgment
- ❌ "Set it and forget it" mentalities
- ❌ Approaches that reduce transparency

## ✅ What We LOVE to See

### Evidence-Based Contributions
- ✅ "I tested this for 2 weeks and here's what happened..."
- ✅ Before/after comparisons with actual examples
- ✅ Failure analysis and lessons learned
- ✅ Specific, reproducible methods

### Collaborative Improvements
- ✅ Better ways to structure negotiations
- ✅ More effective collaboration patterns
- ✅ Improved transparency mechanisms
- ✅ Enhanced user control

### Community-Focused
- ✅ Solutions that help others learn
- ✅ Clear documentation and examples
- ✅ Cultural adaptations
- ✅ Domain-specific applications

## 🏗️ Development Standards
